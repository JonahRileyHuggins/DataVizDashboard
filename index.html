            <strong>Background</strong><br>
            The movie dataset we are working with presents a rich and intriguing source of information. 
            This dataset, sourced from Kaggle.com, encompasses a comprehensive compilation of movie data 
            spanning the years 2000 to 2019. It encompasses essential details such as budget, gross revenue, 
            genre, directorship, and the cast of each film. This dataset is particularly captivating due 
            to its capacity to address a wide spectrum of inquiries, offering valuable insights into the 
            film industry's evolution over the years.
            <br>
            <strong>Motivation</strong><br>
            Our project's motivation is driven by a collective fascination with the world of cinema and 
            the desire to delve deeper into the intricacies of movie data. We harbor a genuine interest in 
            gaining a more profound understanding of the dynamics within the film industry. Additionally, we 
            are keen on expanding our knowledge of Tableau, a tool we are all familiar with but have yet to 
            utilize for dashboard creation. We aspire to master the art of crafting interactive Tableau 
            dashboards that provide in-depth insights into the movie domain. Our objective is to build a 
            dashboard that not only engages users but also serves as a comprehensive repository of information 
            related to the world of movies, encompassing facets like gross revenue, genre trends, actor influence, 
            and directorial impact.
