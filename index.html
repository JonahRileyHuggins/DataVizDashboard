            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Movie data is a very interesting dataset to work with. It is a dataset that is very easy to understand and relate to. It is also a dataset that is very easy to find. There are many different websites that have movie data available for download. The dataset we are using is from Kaggle.com. It is a dataset that has information about movies from 2000 to 2019. It has information about the budget, gross revenue, genre, director, and actors. This dataset is very interesting because it has a lot of information that can be used to answer many different questions. </p>
            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>Our motivation for this project is to learn more about movie data. We are all interested in movies and we are interested in learning more about the movie industry. We are also interested in learning more about how to use Tableau. We have all used Tableau before, but we have never used it to create a dashboard. We are interested in learning more about how to use Tableau to create a dashboard. We are also interested in learning more about how to use Tableau to create a dashboard that is interactive. We are also interested in learning more about how to use Tableau to create a dashboard that is interactive and that has a lot of information. </p>
